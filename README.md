# MovieApp
This project is our exam in Adnroid programming. The app is a movie displaying app that uses glide to get covers from the internet. It also has an embedded youtubeplayer for displaying trailers. This is done in a fragment and the app has a MVVM structure to pass data from our repository to our recyclerviews.
We hope you enjoy it.
